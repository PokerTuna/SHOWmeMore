## Description
SHOWmeMore is a responsive [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) web app that lets it's user find new tv shows.
Based on the primary inquiry, SHOWmeMore will show the user up to 3 tv show recommendations.
Each of these shows can then generate more recommendations - ad infinitum.

## Tools
Key tools used in this ReactJS project are:

* [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Possible improvements/ further development
Those are my ideas for current improvements and further development:

* Improving styling
* Fetch API support for older browsers
* More RWD breakpoints
* SHOWmeMore logo

* Profiles
* Option for the user to store his/her choices and save those for future use.
* Tracker that lets it's user follow TV Shows he/she currently watches
* Notifications for when the next episode airs

## Acknowledgements
If it wasn't for the TMDb, this app might not have been. SHOWmeMore works on the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API, which has been of great help. It's discover method is the backbone of the recommendations.
